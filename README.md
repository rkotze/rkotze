Hi ðŸ‘‹

### On the mind

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and has a massive impact on all environmental factors.

Huge amount of resources water, crops, land, antibiotics and more go into keeping farm animals alive instead of humans directly consuming those basic resouces. This seems massively waistful to me.

So much suffering and death in farming animals it can't be considered [humane](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humane).

IMO, the best thing we can do now is chose a plant-based diet.
