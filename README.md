Hi ðŸ‘‹

### On the mind

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and has a negative impact on our environment.

Huge amount of resources like water, crops, land, antibiotics and more go into keeping farm animals alive instead of humans directly consuming those essential resouces. I my opinion this is very waistful way to produce food.

So much suffering and death in farming animals it can't be considered [humane](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humane).

IMO, the best thing we can do now is chose a plant-based diet and hopefully go Vegan.
